 *
 * We use fuzzy comparisons so that add_path() can avoid keeping both of
 * a pair of paths that really have insignificantly different cost.
 *
 * The fuzz_factor argument must be 1.0 plus delta, where delta is the
 * fraction of the smaller cost that is considered to be a significant
 * difference.  For example, fuzz_factor = 1.01 makes the fuzziness limit
 * be 1% of the smaller cost.
 *
 * The two paths are said to have "equal" costs if both startup and total
 * costs are fuzzily the same.  Path1 is said to be better than path2 if
 * it has fuzzily better startup cost and fuzzily no worse total cost,
 * or if it has fuzzily better total cost and fuzzily no worse startup cost.
 * Path2 is better than path1 if the reverse holds.  Finally, if one path
 * is fuzzily better than the other on startup cost and fuzzily worse on
 * total cost, we just say that their costs are "different", since neither
 * dominates the other across the whole performance spectrum.
 *
 * This function also enforces a policy rule that paths for which the relevant
 * one of parent->consider_startup and parent->consider_param_startup is false
 * cannot survive comparisons solely on the grounds of good startup cost, so
 * we never return COSTS_DIFFERENT when that is true for the total-cost loser.
 * (But if total costs are fuzzily equal, we compare startup costs anyway,

/*
 * add_path
 *	  Consider a potential implementation path for the specified parent rel,
 *	  and add it to the rel's pathlist if it is worthy of consideration.
 *	  A path is worthy if it has a better sort order (better pathkeys) or
 *	  cheaper cost (on either dimension), or generates fewer rows, than any
 *	  existing path that has the same or superset parameterization rels.
 *	  We also consider parallel-safe paths more worthy than others.
 *
 *	  We also remove from the rel's pathlist any old paths that are dominated
 *	  by new_path --- that is, new_path is cheaper, at least as well ordered,
 *	  generates no more rows, requires no outer rels not required by the old
 *	  path, and is no less parallel-safe.
 *
 *	  In most cases, a path with a superset parameterization will generate
 *	  fewer rows (since it has more join clauses to apply), so that those two
 *	  figures of merit move in opposite directions; this means that a path of
 *	  one parameterization can seldom dominate a path of another.  But such
 *	  cases do arise, so we make the full set of checks anyway.
 *
 *	  There are two policy decisions embedded in this function, along with
 *	  its sibling add_path_precheck.  First, we treat all parameterized paths
 *	  as having NIL pathkeys, so that they cannot win comparisons on the
 *	  basis of sort order.  This is to reduce the number of parameterized
 *	  paths that are kept; see discussion in src/backend/optimizer/README.
 *
 *	  Second, we only consider cheap startup cost to be interesting if
 *	  parent_rel->consider_startup is true for an unparameterized path, or
 *	  parent_rel->consider_param_startup is true for a parameterized one.
 *	  Again, this allows discarding useless paths sooner.
 *
 *	  The pathlist is kept sorted by total_cost, with cheaper paths
 *	  at the front.  Within this routine, that's simply a speed hack:
 *	  doing it that way makes it more likely that we will reject an inferior
 *	  path after a few comparisons, rather than many comparisons.
 *	  However, add_path_precheck relies on this ordering to exit early
 *	  when possible.
 *
 *	  NOTE: discarded Path objects are immediately pfree'd to reduce planner
 *	  memory consumption.  We dare not try to free the substructure of a Path,
 *	  since much of it may be shared with other Paths or the query tree itself;
 *	  but just recycling discarded Path nodes is a very useful savings in
 *	  a large join tree.  We can recycle the List nodes of pathlist, too.
 *
 *	  As noted in optimizer/README, deleting a previously-accepted Path is
 *	  safe because we know that Paths of this rel cannot yet be referenced
 *	  from any other rel, such as a higher-level join.  However, in some cases
 *	  it is possible that a Path is referenced by another Path for its own
 *	  rel; we must not delete such a Path, even if it is dominated by the new
 *	  Path.  Currently this occurs only for IndexPath objects, which may be
 *	  referenced as children of BitmapHeapPaths as well as being paths in
 *	  their own right.  Hence, we don't pfree IndexPaths when rejecting them.
 *
 * 'parent_rel' is the relation entry to which the path corresponds.
 * 'new_path' is a potential path for parent_rel.
 *
 * Returns nothing, but modifies parent_rel->pathlist.

/*
 * add_partial_path
 *	  Like add_path, our goal here is to consider whether a path is worthy
 *	  of being kept around, but the considerations here are a bit different.
 *	  A partial path is one which can be executed in any number of workers in
 *	  parallel such that each worker will generate a subset of the path's
 *	  overall result.
 *
 *	  As in add_path, the partial_pathlist is kept sorted with the cheapest
 *	  total path in front.  This is depended on by multiple places, which
 *	  just take the front entry as the cheapest path without searching.
 *
 *	  We don't generate parameterized partial paths for several reasons.  Most
 *	  importantly, they're not safe to execute, because there's nothing to
 *	  make sure that a parallel scan within the parameterized portion of the
 *	  plan is running with the same value in every worker at the same time.
 *	  Fortunately, it seems unlikely to be worthwhile anyway, because having
 *	  each worker scan the entire outer relation and a subset of the inner
 *	  relation will generally be a terrible plan.  The inner (parameterized)
 *	  side of the plan will be small anyway.  There could be rare cases where
 *	  this wins big - e.g. if join order constraints put a 1-row relation on
 *	  the outer side of the topmost join with a parameterized plan on the inner
 *	  side - but we'll have to be content not to handle such cases until
 *	  somebody builds an executor infrastructure that can cope with them.
 *
 *	  Because we don't consider parameterized paths here, we also don't
 *	  need to consider the row counts as a measure of quality: every path will
 *	  produce the same number of rows.  Neither do we need to consider startup
 *	  costs: parallelism is only used for plans that will be run to completion.
 *	  Therefore, this routine is much simpler than add_path: it needs to
 *	  consider only pathkeys and total cost.
 *
 *	  As with add_path, we pfree paths that are found to be dominated by
 *	  another partial path; this requires that there be no other references to
 *	  such paths yet.  Hence, GatherPaths must not be created for a rel until
 *	  we're done creating all partial paths for it.  Unlike add_path, we don't
 *	  take an exception for IndexPaths as partial index paths won't be
 *	  referenced by partial BitmapHeapPaths.
